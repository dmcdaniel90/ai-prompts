# AI Prompts

> A collection of custom-created AI prompts by Devin McDaniel

## Prompt directory

- **Ankredible** - An Anki card-generator. Import info from any file or website your LLM can accept and copy the output into a UTF-8 encoded .txt file for easy import into Anki. Works great with models with web and vision access, such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.7.

- **BetterMe** - A life coach based on principles from the writings of famous authors such as Tim Ferris, James Clear, Brendon Burchard, and more. Please note, the prompt itself contains some explicit language (ala Mark Manson).

## Usage Tips

- Works great with Raycast! Create a preset with the Web Search (or Exa/Firecrawl), Browser, Finder (MacOS), Vision, and Flux/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion extensions to quickly create question sets.
        - That being said, some prompts explicitly state to use certain Raycast extensions. You may need to edit the prompt to suit your uses. Don't forget to attribute anything you create please! üôè
