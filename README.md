## Prompt directory

- **Ankredible** - An Anki card-generator. Import info from any file or website your LLM can accept and copy the output into a UTF-8 encoded .txt file for easy import into Anki. Works great with models with web and vision access, such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.7.

## Usage Tips
- Works great with Raycast! Create a preset with the Web Search (or Exa/Firecrawl), Browser, Finder (MacOS), Vision, and Flux/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion extensions to quickly create question sets.
